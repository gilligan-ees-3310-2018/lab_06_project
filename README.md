# Lab #6 Assignment: Independent Project

## Overview

You will choose an independent project to extend one of the exercises you
did in a previous lab (#2--#5). You will work alone or with a partner
to develop a new question that goes beyond the previous lab assignments, but
builds upon a previous exercise. 

You will prepare a presentation on your project for the lab session on Monday Oct. 9
and you will turn in a formal lab report, prepared with RMarkdown and knitted
successfully into a PDF file by 11:59 pm on Wednesday Oct. 17.

This project contains copies of the scripts we used in previous labs
and a blank RMarkdown file in which you can fill in your lab report.

## Assignment and Resources

The formal assignment has been posted to Brightspace and there
is also a copy in this directory: [lab_06_instructions.pdf](lab_06_instructions.pdf).

There are resources to help you with things like bibliographies, citations,
and other aspects of this project in RMarkdown on Brightspace.
You can get the raw RMarkdown files for those resources at
