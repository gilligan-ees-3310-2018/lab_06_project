# Lab #5 Assignment: Independent Project

## Overview

You will choose an independent project to extend one of the exercises you
did in a previous lab (#2--#5). You will work alone or with a partner
to develop a new question that goes beyond the previous lab assignments, but
builds upon a previous exercise. 

You will prepare a presentation on your project for the lab session on Monday Oct. 9
and you will turn in a formal lab report, prepared with RMarkdown and knitted
successfully into a PDF file by 9:00 am on Wednesday Oct. 11.

This project contains copies of the scripts we used in previous labs
and a blank RMarkdown file in which you can fill in your lab report.
